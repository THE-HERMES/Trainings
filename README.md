  <h1>Trainings</h1>
  <br>

 <p id="en" style="text-align: center;">Access the tutorials in your language and proceed carefully. We will prepare trainings for you from the beginning to the level of expertise and deliver them to you. <br> Progress is planned in a level way. We do not train you to become an expert in your field. We provide you with job opportunities by educating you on the topics that do the most work in this field. When you have mastered the subject by successfully completing the training, we will contact you so that you can be included in our team. I hope you enjoy working with us.</p>

âš¡ There are trainings on specific topics. <br>
âš¡ Do not focus on different subjects other than the training given to you. This will be to your detriment. <br>
âš¡ Review the tutorials at least twice to understand. And do not lose hope. <br>
âš¡ Some packages will have templates inside the compressed file. I hope you like surprises!<br>
ðŸš¨ Please stay in touch with the representatives selected for you. <br>
